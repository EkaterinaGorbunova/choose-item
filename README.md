This project was created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) + [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/?_ga=2.29848767.1050887025.1636032325-1120873093.1636032325).

## Simple Logic
1. User can select one itme of the same category together (1 cupcake and 1 cocktail) but at the same time user cannot select several cupcakes or several cocktails.
2. User can reset all selected items by clicking on "Reset All" button or double-clicking on a chosen item.
3. All items are organized into arrays based on their types - cupcakes and cocktails, so all cupcakes are displayed first, and then - all cocktails.
